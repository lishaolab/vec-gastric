Premalignant lesions of intestinal-type gastric cancer (GC), including intestinal metaplasia (IM) and low-grade dysplasia (LGD), require in-depth molecular characterization to better stratify their progression risk and refine the management strategy. Here, we constructed a single-cell multi-omics profile of 203, 213 cells for intact premalignant and malignant gastric lesions from both human gastric tissues and GC mouse model. We explored the cellular heterogeneity within the premalignant epithelium and identified a concurrent aggressive cell state that resembled GC-related expression programs including features related to epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. We named it as the very-early gastric cancer (VEC) state and systematically uncovered underlying gene regulatory elements by analysing the paired scRNA-seq and snATAC-seq data. Moreover, we delineated VEC-associated spatial organization and clonal architecture by performing spatial transcriptomic analysis and found that the VEC state could spatially mark high-risk LGD glands. Clinically, the VEC state could distinguish high-risk LGD patients who could progress to GC from ‘indolent’ patients and was validated in 301 LGD patients from three independent retrospective longitudinal cohorts. Additionally, we found that the VEC state was associated with a tumour-promoting milieu, characterized by the expansion of proangiogenic stromal cells, and immunosuppressive regulatory T cells and SPP1+ macrophages. Thus, our study paves the way for developing diagnostic and therapeutic targets for early GC intervention.
